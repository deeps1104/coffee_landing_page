            we have a seating area created specifically for you. If you need to rest,
            we have a soft-seating area in front of a stone fire place that is perfect for
            your weary mind and body. We offer a delicious variety of coffee from Safehouse
            Coffee made by our professionally trained baristas. We have everything from classic
            coffee to our house made specialty beverages.  All of our sauces & syrups are made in-house
            with all natural ingredients (no chemicals or preservatives) ensuring you the highest quality in taste & health.
            You can complete your coffee with one of our delicious sweet treats made by our very own baker. We look forward to

            One of the best ways to help coffee farmers increase their incomes, in many cases, is to work with them to enhance the quality and yields of their coffee while promoting value chain improvements that enable farmers to earn a larger share of export prices.
            TechnoServeâ€™s unique approach can also address the farm size problem, helping farmers fund education that enables their children to attain livelihoods off the farm if desired, allowing coffee farms to become larger and more profitable in the future.

          TechnoServe is applying these solutions to help build a sustainable global coffee industry that can lift millions of farming families out of poverty. For five decades, we have developed a set of market-based solutions to meet this challenge and applied them in communities across Africa and Latin America.
